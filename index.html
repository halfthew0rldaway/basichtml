            <p>Ah, another website—because the internet clearly didn’t have enough of those. But hey, you’re here now, so might as well make yourself comfortable. I’m bLeu (yeah, it’s a nickname), a <strong>digital hoarder, technician, and vector artist</strong> who spends way too much time tinkering with software, breaking things just to fix them again, and pretending to understand AI like everyone else these days.</p>
    
            <p>Technology is both my passion and my problem. I’ll spend hours fixing a device that wasn’t really broken, refuse to delete a single file because “I might need it in 10 years,” and hoard unfinished projects like they’re rare collectibles. Somewhere between reviving gadgets and designing vectors, I convince myself this chaos is just <em>"organized innovation."</em> My storage is always full, my projects never-ending, and my patience constantly running on low battery—but hey, that’s just the price of being a <strong>functional</strong> digital mess.</p>
